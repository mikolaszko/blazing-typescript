## About the project
This project is a natual progression of my professional work as a React Engineer. TypeScript is the main language I use everyday and I find myself 
reaching more and more for advanced features and not-so-obvious utility types. I am not a TS wizard yet but I aspire to become one in the near future
so __BLAZING-TS__ (because everything has to be *blazingly* fast) enables me to learn and create something fun!

## How to use?
The library is in a __very__ early stage of development but hey, it's available as NPM package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blazing-ts).

To install just run ```TypeScript npm i blazing-ts``` 

Here's how the import statement looks like:

## What the library will cover?

All the primitive types and anything I can think of. I started of by creating some basic types for objects because well - I write __A LOT__ of object
types at work

## Documentation
I will create a site with all things clearly written out (i've done this before actually and it will look similarly to the LunarVim docs page). For now
I think the actual sustence of this library is more important then the fancy docs. For each type there's a .d.ts file and they are very simple for now 
so no need to panic :D
